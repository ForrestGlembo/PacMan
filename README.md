# PacMan

Description-

This is a project that tested our ability to manipulate and create moving objects within the browser. The pacmen can be created and sped up, and are confined to a set area within the browser window.

How to run-

Click add pacman to add as many pacmen as you want, then click start game to make them move and bounce off the walls. You can click start game again to increase the speed. 

Roadmap-

I would like to add the ability to make the pacmen themselves be chomping while they move instead of just static, as well as have the spawn more randomly across the screen instead of such a confined area.
